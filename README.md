Moodle Plugin for merging pdf files in a course

The ‘Merge PDF Files’ plugin offers the user a convenient way by which he/she can merge the files (only PDF documents) in a Moodle course. 
This plugin requires 2 tools:
 1- PDFtk (short for PDF Toolkit) is a cross-platform tool for manipulating Portable Document Format (PDF) documents. It comes in three flavors: PDFtk Free, PDFtk Pro, and a command-line tool PDFtk Server.
 2- LaTeX – A document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing.

The module is created and is currently being worked upon at IIT, Bombay (India). 

How to use?
After applying this patch to moodle:
 1- Go to a particular course
 2- Click on settings icon
 3- A link saying "Merge PDF files" will appear in the course settings (drop-down menu) list.

 5- At the end of this page, you get a button labeled "Merge pdf files".
